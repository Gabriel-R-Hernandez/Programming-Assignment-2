NORMALIZATION PROBLEM
I first made a 5×5 random array to have some data to work with.
Then I found the mean and standard deviation so I know the center and spread of the numbers.
After that, I used the formula (X - mean)/std to normalize the array so the values are centered around 0 and have equal scale.
I printed each step to see what was happening and to make sure it looked right.
Finally, I saved the normalized array as X_normalized.npy.

DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
I made numbers from 1 to 100 and squared them to get simple data.
Then I reshaped it into a 10×10 matrix to organize the numbers neatly. 
I printed the matrix to check if it looked right.
After that, I filtered out the numbers divisible by 3 using a condition.
I printed those results to make sure the filter worked. 
Lastly, I saved them into a file called divisible_by_3.npy.
